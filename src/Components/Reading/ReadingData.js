export const easyRead = `I guess Mom was pretty proud of herself for making me write in that journal last year, because now she went and bought me another one. But remember how I said that if some jerk caught me carrying a book with “diary” on the cover they were gonna get the wrong idea? Well, that’s exactly what happened today. Now that  Rodrick knows I have another journal, I better remember to keep this one locked up. Rodrick actually got ahold of my LAST journal a few weeks back, and it was a disaster. But don’t even get me started on THAT story. Even without my Rodrick problems, my summer was pretty lousy. Our family didn’t go anywhere or do anything fun, and that’s Dad’s fault. Dad made me join the swim team again, and he wanted to make sure I didn’t miss any meets this year. Dad’s got this idea that I’m destined to be a great swimmer or something, so that’s why he makes me join the team every summer. At my first swim meet a couple of years ago, Dad told me that when the umpire shot off the starter pistol, I was supposed to dive in and start swimming. But what he DIDN’T tell me was that the starter gun only fired BLANKS. So I was a whole lot more worried about where the bullet was gonna land than I was about getting myself to the other end of the pool. Even After Dad explained the whole “starter pistol” concept to me, I was still the worst swimmer on the team. But I did end up winning “Most Improved” at the awards banquet at the end of the summer. That’s only because there was a ten-minute difference between my first race and my last one. So I guess Dad’s still waiting for me to live up to my potential. In a lot of ways, being on the swim team was worse than being in middle school. First of all, we had to be at the pool by 7:30 every morning, and the water was always FREEZING cold. And second of all, we were all crammed into two lanes, so I always had somebody on my tail trying to get around me. The reason we had to use two lanes was because swim practice was at the same time as the Water Jazz class. I actually tried to convince Dad to let me do Water Jazz instead of swim team, but he wouldn’t go for it.`;

export const hardRead = `The probability of success (POS) of a clinical trial is critical for clinical researchers and biopharma investors to evaluate when making scientific and economic decisions. Prudent resource allocation relies on the accurate and timely assessment of risk. Without up-to-date estimates of the POS, however, investors may misjudge the risk and value of drug development, leading to lost opportunities for both investors and patients. One of the biggest challenges in estimating the success rate of clinical trials is access to accurate information on trial characteristics and outcomes. Gathering such data is expensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to error. Previous studies of success rates have been constrained by the data in several respects. Abrantes-Metz and others (2005) surveyed 2328 drugs using 3136 phase transitions (e.g., from Phase 1 to Phase 2 in the approval process), while DiMasi and others (2010) studied 1316 drugs from just 50 companies. In the landmark study of this area, Hay and others (2014) analyzed 7372 development paths of 4451 drugs using 5820 phase transitions. In two recent papers, Smietana and others (2016) computed statistics using 17 358 phase transitions for 9200 compounds, while Thomas and others (2016) used 9985 phase transitions for 7455 clinical drug development programs. In contrast, ClinicalTrials.gov, the clinical trial repository maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), contains over 217 000 clinical trial entries submitted by various organizations as of July 1, 2016 (see www.clinicaltrials.gov). It is estimated that trained analysts would require tens of thousands of hours of labor to incorporate its full information manually to produce POS estimates. In this article, we construct estimates of the POS and other related risk characteristics of clinical trials using 406 038 entries of industry- and non-industry-sponsored trials, corresponding to 185 994 unique trials over 21 143 compounds from Informa Pharma Intelligence’s Trialtrove and Pharmaprojects databases from January 1, 2000 to October 31, 2015. This is the largest investigation thus far into clinical trial success rates and related parameters. To process this large amount of data, we develop an automated algorithm that traces the path of drug development, infers the phase transitions, and computes the POS statistics in hours. In this article, we introduce the “path-by-path” approach that traces the proportion of development paths that make it from one phase to the next. In contrast, extant literature uses what we call the “phase-by-phase” approach, which estimates the POS from a random sample of observed phase transitions. Apart from the gains in efficiency, our algorithmic approach allows us to perform previously infeasible computations, such as generating time-series estimates of POS and related parameters. We estimate aggregate success rates, completion rates (CRs), phase-transition probabilities, and trial durations, as well as more disaggregated measures across various dimensions such as clinical phase, disease, type of organization, and whether biomarkers are used. Before presenting these and other results, we begin by discussing our methodology and describing some features of our data set.`;
